# Project 2: Building My First Full-stack Application
***

This project was coded in Ruby, postgreSQL, HTML and CSS with the help from DT, Kasun, YouTube vids, Google and the fullslack team.

## Approach

When the project was handed to me, I thought of a few ideas of what to build as my first full-stack application. After careful consideration, I decided to come up with a sneaker app where sneaker enthusiasts could upload their favourite pair of sneakers on the app to showcase and comment on it. I started building the app by making the index page and expand from there.

## What I learned

I learned at first that making an app was daunting as there are lots of new syntax to learn.
After a few revisions and making the first few app pages, it gets slightly easier as most of the time its just about requesting and responding to the server using the language which the server is able to compute. Getting to know the basic definitions of Get, Post, Put and Delete are very important aspects of making this app. Refering to previous exercises (movieapp and goodfoodhunting) which we had helped me to understand the whole concept too.

Once I understand the basics, it became easier to understand what each page, button or form is supposed to do. At times, I do find a few obstacles along the way but that is mainly due to wrong methods used in forms or not closing/ending if else statements. Indentation and making the code look clean is helpful to find those mistakes as it is more readable.  A simple restart of ruby console could at times help with making the app to start working again. I've also learned that the error messages are actually helping to tell me where I went wrong with my code. Error messages are your friends to assist you to rectify your mistakes. I've also learned that using percentages rather than pixels for image size in CSS is better as it will accomodate to the users' device.

## Unsolved problems

The more I upload sneakers pics and info into the index page, I noticed that the background image increased in size. This must be due to the size of the background image trying to accomodate to the number of sneakers in that page.

## To Do List

 * Write better and cleaner code
 * Delete individual comment button
 * Only list the last 5 comments rather than having old comments on them
 * Make the background image to accomodate the amount of sneakers info that can fit into the index page

## Future features

  * Making a separate login for administrators and customers
  * Allowing customers to purchase sneakers by making purchase button
  * Have more images of the sneakers from different angles (i.e. maybe customer can click on the image to change view angles of the sneaker)
  * Make a purchase cart so customers can enter their credit card details
  * Password reset form if customer forgotten their password
  * Address info page for customers when they made their purchases

  [Enjoy my first full-stack app! =)]
